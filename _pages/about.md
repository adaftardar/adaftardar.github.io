I am a 4th year PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU. I'm advised by Brandon Reagen, Siddharth Garg, and closely collaborate with Benedikt BÃ¼nz. I'm a member of the BAAHL and Ensure groups at NYU.

My research focuses on computer architecture and VLSI for privacy-preserving cryptography, primarily for Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

I received my Masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UMich in 2022, where I worked on VLSI for communications and machine learning with David Blaauw, Hun-Seok Kim, and Ron Dreslinski. I received my Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2020 where I worked with Vincent Mooney and Matthieu Bloch.
